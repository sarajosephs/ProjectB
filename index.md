# Water in New York City

Today we are presented with new challenges associated with climate change, maintenance and enhancement of current conservation measures and continuing demands for economic development in upstate watershed communities.  

Water is one of the world‚Äôs most precious resources ‚Äì but as the planet‚Äôs climate changes and the population rises, up to 5.7 billion people could be living in areas where water is scarce for at least one month a year by 2050. That‚Äôs why companies and individuals are exploring ways of saving this life-giving liquid.

The NYC Watershed is an area of over 2,000 square miles. It drains its rainwater and snowmelt into 19 reservoirs and 3 controlled lakes, providing over 1 billion gallons of clean drinking water to more than 9 million New Yorkers every day. Over half the population of New York! (https://mywoodlot.com/item/the-new-york-city-watershed-explained)

In the preceding sections we will explore how water consumption has changed as the population increases in New York City. 


> *Why New York?*
> New York City has one of the largest surface water supply systems in the US. It is also committed to providing high quality drinking water to residents and visitors. As an example between the years 2015 and 2025, New York aims to install or repair 500 water fountains and water bottle refilling stations to encourage proper hydration

# Water Consumption in the City of New York


## Is there a linear trend between water consumption and population growth? Is there a trend between the years?

We wanted to investigate if there is a linear decline in water consumption as can be inferred from the graphs above (ef √æa√∞ eru gr√∂f fyrir ofan fr√° Helgu). A machine learning strategy called *Linear Regression* was used to see if there is an association/correlation between population and the years and water consumption and the years. When referring to water, the unit *MGD* refers to millions of gallons per day. From the left figure below it is evident that there is a linear decline in water consumption with coefficient of determination  $¬¥ùëÖ^2=0.898¬¥$. The coefficient being close to 1 means that there is a strong relation between water consumption and years which supports our assumption. Additionally, looking at the population growth it seems that there is a linear increase, although in general population growth is a common example of exponential growth, but that is in an ideal environment [Reference](https://www.britannica.com/science/population-ecology/Logistic-population-growth). The model had  $'ùëÖ^2=0.96'$ , even better than the fit for the water consumption, which indicates that in New York the population growth is highly dependent on the years and is increasing at a fast rate! ?? of scientific?. Another interesting thing we noticed was that there is also a strong relationship between the large increase in population and decrease in water consumption which we explored above?? The reason for that..
